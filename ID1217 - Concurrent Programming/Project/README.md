# The Gravitational N-body Problem

In this project you are to develop and to evaluate efficient parallel programs for a particle computation to solve the gravitational N-body problem, conduct evaluation experiments to analyze the performance of your programs or/and the amount of communication, and write a report describing your results and what you have learned
