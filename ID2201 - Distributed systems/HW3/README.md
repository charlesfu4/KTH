# Loggy - a logical time logger

Keeping track of order of events.

In this homework assignment you are expected to learn how to use logical time in a practical example. The task is to implement a logging procedure that receives log events from a set of workers. The events are tagged with the Lamport time stamp of the worker and the events must be ordered before written to stdout. It is slightly more tricky than one might first think.
